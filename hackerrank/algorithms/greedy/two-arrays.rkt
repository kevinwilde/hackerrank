;; You are given two integer arrays, A and B, each containing N integers.
;; Is there an permutation A', B' possible of A and B, such that, A'i+B'i â‰¥ K
;; for all i, where A'i denotes the ith element in the array A' and B'i denotes
;; the ith element in the array B'.
;;
;; Input Format
;; The first line contains an integer, T, the number of test-cases. T test cases
;; follow. Each test case has the following format:
;;
;; The first line contains two integers, N and K. The second line contains N
;; space separated integers, denoting array A. The third line describes array B
;; in a same format.
;;
;; Output Format
;; For each test case, if such an arrangement exists, output "YES", otherwise
;; "NO" (without quotes).
